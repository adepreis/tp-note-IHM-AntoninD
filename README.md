## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purpose.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the project :

- [Java 8 SE](https://www.java.com/fr/download/)

If you use a later JDK, be careful because JavaFX is decoupled from the JDK since the JDK 11.
You have to download it separately [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
